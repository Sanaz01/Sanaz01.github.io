## Introduction

I am a Bioinformatician/ Computational Biologist working at [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/), Seattle WA. I use cancer biology and advanced computational algorithms to interpret data from cancer patients and infer the mutations as well as differential gene expression profiles. Currently, I am focusing on leukemia â€” cancer of the blood or bone marrow.

Besides work, I enjoy drinking chai (it's not chai tea!) and working out. I am a swimmer and have represented in National and State level championships in India.
